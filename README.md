I'm experiencing an error getting my simulator to run. Also, when I push to GitHub the project repo shows every project on my desktop computer. I tried everything in my wheel house to change this and i cannot figure it out. Since I have now wasted 2.5 hours trying to fix this project I am going to leave it until someone can show me how to fix my error. Thus, I won't be able to view my project at all while I develop it. GRRRR.
